# Calendar App (Angular 17) - Minimal

This is a minimal Angular 17 calendar application with:
- Monthly view
- Create events (Reactive Forms)
- LocalStorage persistence
- RxJS (BehaviorSubject) for state
- No external calendar libraries

## Setup
1. Install Angular CLI globally if not installed:
   npm i -g @angular/cli

2. Install dependencies:
   npm install

3. Run:
   npm start
   or
   ng serve --open

## Notes
- This project is intentionally minimal for interview/demo purposes.
- Uses localStorage for persistence; easy to replace with HTTP calls.
